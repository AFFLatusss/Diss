iOS Application is under the folder iOS_App/plane_disease_identification

To test the application, open plant_disease_identification folder with XCode and build.
Once the build is successful, then the app can run on the simulator. To test images with the app, drag the images into the simulator so that the images will be shown in the simulator's photo library.
